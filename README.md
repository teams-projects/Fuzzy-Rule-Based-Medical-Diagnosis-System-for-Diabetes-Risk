# Fuzzy-Rule-Based-Medical-Diagnosis-System-for-Diabetes-Risk
This project implements a Fuzzy Rule-Based Medical Diagnosis System for assessing the risk of diabetes using real-world health indicators. It applies Granular Computing principles, specifically Mamdani fuzzy inference, to model uncertainty and imprecision in medical decision-making. The system uses the Diabetes Health Indicators dataset, combining medical features (BMI, Blood Pressure), demographic attributes (Age, Gender), and lifestyle factors (Smoking, Alcohol Consumption, Sleep Quality). Each input variable is mapped to fuzzy sets with carefully designed membership functions, and a rule base of expert-inspired IF–THEN rules generates an interpretable diabetes risk score. The fuzzy model is evaluated against traditional machine learning baselines (Logistic Regression / Decision Tree) to compare performance and interpretability. The repository includes data preprocessing scripts, fuzzy system implementation, evaluation metrics, visualizations, and a complete project report.
